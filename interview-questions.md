# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props are part of a function in react and you access the parameter of the function using props. Props means properties, and it is a javascript object. 

  Researched answer: Props is a word in React that means properties and is known for connecting data from one component to another. Props are objects used to pass arguments into React components like function arguments. It can only be passed to components in one way (e.g.parent to child). Props return back to an object element.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: Document Object Model also known as DOM is the user interface that happens when we are looking at a web page. Basically, whatever I am seing on a web page is through the DOM. The DOM is represented as a tree data structure and the DOM event admits Javascript to register distinct event handlers on elements in an HTML document.

  Researched answer: DOM events are usually used in combination with functions. React behavior is based on user events, which means that the function will not be executed unless an event occurs. For example, a user clicks a button on a page and an event is triggered. 



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: An object-oriented programming provides an easy way to add new data and functions. Because it is based on objects, classes are used and the methods and data can be changed as needed, making it dynamic. It is different than functional programming because, as the functional programing uses function and variables to complete a specific task, the result is unchangeable once it is created and it follows declarative program. 


  Researched answer:  An Object oriented programming is based on an object oriented concept. It may deal with the complexity of large software systems. Classes are used when objects are created, meaning that fundamental elements used are objects and methods and the data used is mutable and is different from functional programming. This is because the functional programming uses functions to perform a specific task. The fundamental elements are variables and functions and they are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation. 
  
  
  
4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: The difference between a float and an integer in Ruby is the numerical data. While a float is a number that has decimal positions, an integer is a number without a decimal point. 

  Researched answer: Ruby has some distinct data types for working with numbers and two of the fundamental choices are integers and floats. Integers are used when not performing calculations with the values, because it is rounded to the closest whole number. As an example, if you take 2/216 the integer will give the result as 0 because it understands that the user would rather a rounded value. In the real world, when users are creating aplications, floats are a better option, since it gives back more accurate values. Also, when working with calculations, the user need to get precise values for their result.  


5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: It means that when a return is not clear with a method, Ruby will give back the value of the most recent executed information in the method. 

  Researched answer: It means that Ruby handled the flow of calls. The blocks in Ruby were created to automatically return the last line of the value input, so it does not require the use of the return key when creating a code. Many programmers would rather write the return keyword in Ruby when writing long lines of code because it makes it much harder for them to break the code without realizing it.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable:  In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class. When a number of objects are created from the same class blueprint, they each have their own distinct copies of instance variables. In the case of the Bicycle class, the instance variables are cadence, gear, and speed. Each Bicycle object has its own values for these variables, stored in different memory locations.

2. PostgreSQL: It is a highly stable database management system, backed by more than 20 years of community development which has contributed to its high levels of resilience, integrity, and correctness. PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store or data warehouse for many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications.

3. Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails is an open-source software used to build web applications. Rails is a framework used to create websites using the general-purpose programming language Ruby. Ruby ranks amongst the top ten programming languages predominantly because of the voguishness of Rails.

4. ORM: Objectâ€“relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.

5. Active Record: Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic. Active Record facilitates the creation and use of business objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database.
